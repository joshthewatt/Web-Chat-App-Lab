# Web-Chat-App-Lab

This was a lab that I did from https://fireship.io/ that helped me learn the basics of Firebase and ReactJS.

To run the app, run 'superchat' as a normal React application.

This project is a chat room that allows users to send messages (not actually web-serviced) and the messages are backed up in Firebase.

Includes using Google User Authentication and an Auto-Scroll feature as a user sends a message.
